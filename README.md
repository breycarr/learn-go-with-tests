# Hello, Go

This is the completed chapter 2 of [Chris James "Learn Go with Tests"](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)

The objective of this excercise was to establish testing pattterns using Hello World and extracting it out into a more complex code by iteration. 

The changes for each iteration can been seen in the individual commits. 

For context, the relevant chapter can be found [here](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/blob/master/hello-world.md)
